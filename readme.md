Definition of Dependency Injection (DI):

    Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern in software engineering used to achieve loose coupling between components
 by externalizing their dependencies. In DI, dependencies are injected into a component from the outside rather than being 
 instantiated internally.

Tight coupling between components can lead to code that is difficult to maintain, test, and refactor. Dependency injection addresses 
these issues by promoting loose coupling, making components more modular and independent. DI enhances the flexibility and testability 
of code by allowing dependencies to be easily replaced or mocked during testing.

TYPES:
1. Constructor Injection
2. Setter Injection
3. Interface Injection
